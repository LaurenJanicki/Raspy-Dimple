/**
 *  Join Controller:
 *
 *  This controller handles aspects of the join view, when a player on a mobile device
 *  wants to join an existing game. There are two things that this controller looks
 *  for:
 *
 *  1. The Game ID: this will look for the game in Firebase's DB server, attach the
 *     player to this game and return the game object from the server.
 *     TODO: Check whether or not the game already exists in the server. Right now,
 *     this creates a new game instance if it doesn't already exist. We should show 
 *     an error.
 *  2. The player's name: This adds a player to the game. All players are given a unique
 *     ID, but (TODO) we should probably check if the player's name is already in the game
 *     to avoid player confusion.
